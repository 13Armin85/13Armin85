👋 Hey, I’m Armin — a full-stack developer passionate about clean design and elegant, scalable code.
💡 I work with React, Next.js, Django, and Python, building modern, responsive, and high-performance web applications. I enjoy turning ideas into full-stack products — from sleek front-end interfaces to robust back-end systems.
🌱 I’m constantly refining my skills in React, Next.js, and Django to deliver better user experiences and maintainable architectures.
🤝 Open to collaborating on innovative full-stack projects or startups.
