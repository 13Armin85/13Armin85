👋 Hey, I’m Armin — a front-end developer who loves clean design and elegant code.

💡 I work mostly with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React — and I enjoy building modern, responsive UIs.
🌱 Currently deepening my React & Next.js skills while exploring Python and Django for full-stack development.
🤝 Looking to collaborate on exciting frontend projects or startups.

🎮 Fun fact: I’m a night owl, gamer, and always up for learning something new.
